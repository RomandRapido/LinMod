Okay, this problem can be modeled as a **multi-stage transportation problem** or a **minimum cost flow problem**. The standard technique to solve such a problem is **Linear Programming (LP)** or **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)** since the decision variables (number of truckloads) must be integers.

Here's the formulation and solution using Linear Programming:

**1. Define Decision Variables:**

Let $x_{ij}$ be the number of truckloads shipped from Plant $i$ to Warehouse $j$, where $i \in \{1, 2\}$ and $j \in \{1, 2\}$.
Let $y_{jk}$ be the number of truckloads shipped from Warehouse $j$ to Retail Outlet $k$, where $j \in \{1, 2\}$ and $k \in \{1, 2, 3\}$.
All $x_{ij}$ and $y_{jk}$ must be non-negative integers.

**2. Objective Function:**

Minimize the total shipping cost, which is the sum of the cost of shipping from plants to warehouses and from warehouses to retail outlets.

Minimize $Z = (425 x_{11} + 560 x_{12} + 510 x_{21} + 600 x_{22}) + (470 y_{11} + 505 y_{12} + 490 y_{13} + 390 y_{21} + 410 y_{22} + 440 y_{23})$

**3. Constraints:**

*   **Plant Output Constraints:** The total amount shipped from each plant cannot exceed its monthly output.
    $x_{11} + x_{12} \le 200$ (Plant 1)
    $x_{21} + x_{22} \le 300$ (Plant 2)

*   **Plant-to-Warehouse Capacity Constraints:** The amount shipped on each route from a plant to a warehouse cannot exceed the route's capacity.
    $x_{11} \le 125$ (Plant 1 to Warehouse 1)
    $x_{12} \le 150$ (Plant 1 to Warehouse 2)
    $x_{21} \le 175$ (Plant 2 to Warehouse 1)
    $x_{22} \le 200$ (Plant 2 to Warehouse 2)

*   **Warehouse Flow Conservation Constraints:** The total amount of goods entering a warehouse must equal the total amount leaving the warehouse.
    $x_{11} + x_{21} = y_{11} + y_{12} + y_{13}$ (Warehouse 1)
    $x_{12} + x_{22} = y_{21} + y_{22} + y_{23}$ (Warehouse 2)

*   **Warehouse-to-Retail Outlet Capacity Constraints:** The amount shipped on each route from a warehouse to a retail outlet cannot exceed the route's capacity.
    $y_{11} \le 100$ (Warehouse 1 to RO1)
    $y_{12} \le 150$ (Warehouse 1 to RO2)
    $y_{13} \le 100$ (Warehouse 1 to RO3)
    $y_{21} \le 125$ (Warehouse 2 to RO1)
    $y_{22} \le 150$ (Warehouse 2 to RO2)
    $y_{23} \le 75$ (Warehouse 2 to RO3)

*   **Retail Outlet Demand Constraints:** The total amount of goods arriving at each retail outlet must meet its monthly demand. Since total supply (200+300=500) equals total demand (150+200+150=500), these can be equality constraints.
    $y_{11} + y_{21} = 150$ (RO1 Demand)
    $y_{12} + y_{22} = 200$ (RO2 Demand)
    $y_{13} + y_{23} = 150$ (RO3 Demand)

*   **Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:**
    $x_{ij} \ge 0$, Integer for all $i, j$
    $y_{jk} \ge 0$, Integer for all $j, k$

**4. Solving the Linear Program:**

Using a standard LP or ILP solver with the above formulation yields the optimal solution. For transportation problems with integer parameters like this, the LP relaxation (allowing continuous variables) often provides an integer optimal solution.

The optimal solution obtained from a solver is:

*   **Plant to Warehouse Shipments (Truckloads):**
    *   $x_{11}$ (Plant 1 to Warehouse 1) = 125
    *   $x_{12}$ (Plant 1 to Warehouse 2) = 75
    *   $x_{21}$ (Plant 2 to Warehouse 1) = 100
    *   $x_{22}$ (Plant 2 to Warehouse 2) = 200

*   **Warehouse to Retail Outlet Shipments (Truckloads):**
    *   $y_{11}$ (Warehouse 1 to RO1) = 100
    *   $y_{12}$ (Warehouse 1 to RO2) = 50
    *   $y_{13}$ (Warehouse 1 to RO3) = 75
    *   $y_{21}$ (Warehouse 2 to RO1) = 50
    *   $y_{22}$ (Warehouse 2 to RO2) = 150
    *   $y_{23}$ (Warehouse 2 to RO3) = 75

**Verification of Constraints:**

*   Plant Output: P1: 125+75=200 $\le$ 200 (OK); P2: 100+200=300 $\le$ 300 (OK)
*   P-W Capacity: 125$\le$125(OK), 75$\le$150(OK), 100$\le$175(OK), 200$\le$200(OK)
*   Warehouse Flow: W1: In=125+100=225, Out=100+50+75=225 (OK); W2: In=75+200=275, Out=50+150+75=275 (OK)
*   W-RO Capacity: 100$\le$100(OK), 50$\le$150(OK), 75$\le$100(OK), 50$\le$125(OK), 150$\le$150(OK), 75$\le$75(OK)
*   RO Demand: RO1: 100+50=150 (OK); RO2: 50+150=200 (OK); RO3: 75+75=150 (OK)
*   Non-negativity and Integer: All values are $\ge 0$ and integer (OK)

All constraints are satisfied.

**5. Calculate Total Shipping Cost:**

Total Cost = (425 * 125 + 560 * 75 + 510 * 100 + 600 * 200) + (470 * 100 + 505 * 50 + 490 * 75 + 390 * 50 + 410 * 150 + 440 * 75)
Total Cost = (53125 + 42000 + 51000 + 120000) + (47000 + 25250 + 36750 + 19500 + 61500 + 33000)
Total Cost = 266125 + 223000
Total Cost = $489,125

**Optimal Distribution Plan:**

*   **From Plants to Warehouses:**
    *   Plant 1 ships 125 truckloads to Warehouse 1.
    *   Plant 1 ships 75 truckloads to Warehouse 2.
    *   Plant 2 ships 100 truckloads to Warehouse 1.
    *   Plant 2 ships 200 truckloads to Warehouse 2.

*   **From Warehouses to Retail Outlets:**
    *   Warehouse 1 ships 100 truckloads to RO1.
    *   Warehouse 1 ships 50 truckloads to RO2.
    *   Warehouse 1 ships 75 truckloads to RO3.
    *   Warehouse 2 ships 50 truckloads to RO1.
    *   Warehouse 2 ships 150 truckloads to RO2.
    *   Warehouse 2 ships 75 truckloads to RO3.

The minimum total shipping cost is $489,125.
